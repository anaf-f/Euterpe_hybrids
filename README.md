This repository contains the R scripts used in the article "How can anthropogenic action expand hybridization and introgression in the genus Euterpe? " to carry out ecological niche modelling with the ENMTML package (Andrade et al., 2020) and ecological niche overlap with the Ecospat package (Di Cola et al., 2017).
